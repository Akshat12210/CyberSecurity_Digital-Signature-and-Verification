# Digital Signature and Verification

- A digital signature is a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital document or message.
- It is a unique code that is generated using the private key of a cryptographic key pair, and it is attached to the document or message to verify that it has not been altered in any way.
- The recipient of the message or document can then use the sender's public key to verify the digital signature and ensure that the message or document is authentic and has not been tampered with.
